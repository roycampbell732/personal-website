One of my favourite things to do has been mentoring younger guys.
I believe mentoring to be two or three guys / girls journeying / doing life together where the older is usually (but not always) one step, ahead of the younger and helps bring clarity to decisions.

Over the years, I've written software for companies to:

* manage retail sales, keeping track of daily sales by department for reporting purposes,
* manage gasbar sales, keeping track of customers with accounts and providing statements as necessary,
* keep track of sales opportunities in a "funnel", and track the opportunities from initial contact to implementation,
* allow employees to submit timecards with charges against projects such that they could ratify in real time that the hours they were charging were actually still available in the project.
* provide document management and appropriate team access to documents,
* automate their shipping process taking requests from clients and turning them into shipping requests for fulfillment,
* automate helpdesk tasks freeing up technicians to perform more meaningful client support related tasks,
* track electrical costs and outputs from providers for being better able to consult with clients about their energy needs.

I'm also currently doing some data science work looking at data for organizations and providing graphical output that aids with decision making.

For 10+ years I was on the leadership team for the International Conference on Computing and Mission (ICCM) in the US.  I lead or co-lead the conference for 7 of those years.
I also co-founded the ICCM-Africa conference and co-lead it for its first three years.
In 2013, I was the keynote speaker at ICCM-Australia talking about the intersection of Faith and Technology and how they work together, outlining the use of technology in Scripture.

From 2016 to 2020 I worked at Learning for Humanity (Incorporated and Alliance) which I co-founded.  There I was responsible for all things technical from Hardware to Software to data storage to school and classroom infrastructure.

Statements that guide my work decisions:
* "Can it be done" is usually the wrong question - the right question is a combination of "how would we do it?" and "is it feasible in our circumstances with our resources?"
* Who are we helping and who is potentially being hurt and how do we mitigate that?
* Cadillac solutions for the bicycle budget
* What's the best practice and does it dictate a commercial solution or will open-source do as good or better job
