    <p>One of my favourite things to do has been mentoring younger guys.
I believe mentoring to be two or three guys / girls journeying / doing life together where the older is usually (but not always) one step, ahead of the younger and helps bring clarity to decisions.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've written software for companies to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>manage retail sales, keeping track of daily sales by department for reporting purposes,</p></li>
<li><p>manage gasbar sales, keeping track of customers with accounts and providing statements as necessary,</p></li>
<li><p>keep track of sales opportunities in a "funnel", and track the opportunities from initial contact to implementation,</p></li>
<li><p>allow employees to submit timecards with charges against projects such that they could ratify in real time that the hours they were charging were actually still available in the project.</p></li>
<li><p>provide document management and appropriate team access to documents,</p></li>
<li><p>automate their shipping process taking requests from clients and turning them into shipping requests for fulfillment,</p></li>
<li><p>automate helpdesk tasks freeing up technicians to perform more meaningful client support related tasks,</p></li>
<li><p>track electrical costs and outputs from providers for being better able to consult with clients about their energy needs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also currently doing some data science work looking at data for organizations and providing graphical output that aids with decision making.</p>
<p>For 10+ years I was on the leadership team for the International Conference on Computing and Mission (ICCM) in the US.  I lead or co-lead the conference for 7 of those years.
I also co-founded the ICCM-Africa conference and co-lead it for its first three years.
In 2013, I was the keynote speaker at ICCM-Australia talking about the intersection of Faith and Technology and how they work together, outlining the use of technology in Scripture.</p>
<p>From 2016 to 2020 I worked at Learning for Humanity (Incorporated and Alliance) which I co-founded.  There I was responsible for all things technical from Hardware to Software to data storage to school and classroom infrastructure.</p>
<p>Philosophy of life:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>do no harm (easier said than done)</p></li>
<li><p>when designing a solution, ask questions like who's benefitting and who's being hurt (even inadvertently)</p></li>
<li><p>help the widow, orphan, refugee, and otherwise marginalized ahead of the wealthy (the wealthy can usually help themselves)</p></li>
<li><p>I've been told I have a "can do" attitude: "Can it be done" is usually the wrong question - the right question is a combination of "how can it be done?", "should we do it?" and "is it feasible?"</p></li>
<li><p>what's the best practice and does it dictate a commercial solution or will open-source do as good or better job?</p></li>
</ul>
