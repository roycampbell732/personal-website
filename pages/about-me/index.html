    <p>I am a Husband, Father, Grandfather who has an incredibly rich life with his family.</p>
<p>I am also:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a follower of Jesus Christ</p></li>
<li><p>a hockey fan (my favourite teams are the Ottawa Senators and Edmonton Oilers) and beer league player</p></li>
<li><p>a competitive crokinole player - I use Tracey Boards (<a class="reference external" href="https://traceyboards.com">https://traceyboards.com</a>), the official boards of the World Crokinole Championships.  The WCC is held the first Saturday of June, each year, in Tavistock, ON Canada</p></li>
<li><p>a Coffee enjoyer - I prefer a good medium-dark roast.  I use both the Aero-Press Coffee press as well as a Breville espresso machine</p></li>
<li><p>a supporter of local micro breweries - Rural Roots in Elmira</p></li>
<li><p>a gamer (both board games - mostly euro style - and computer games - sports preferred)</p></li>
<li><p>a traveller, favourite destination so far, Kenya</p></li>
<li><p>a computer consultant / programmer - I mostly use Python to solve automation and data science problems with occasional web development thrown in</p></li>
<li><p>and occasionally a speaker</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Philosophy of life:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>do no harm (easier said than done)</p></li>
<li><p>when designing a solution, ask questions like who's benefitting and who's being hurt (even inadvertently)</p></li>
<li><p>help the widow, orphan, refugee, and otherwise marginalized ahead of the wealthy (the wealthy can usually help themselves)</p></li>
<li><p>I've been told I have a "can do" attitude: "Can it be done" is usually the wrong question - the right question is a combination of "how can it be done?", "should we do it?" and "is it feasible?"</p></li>
<li><p>what's the best practice and does it dictate a commercial solution or will open-source do as good or better job?</p></li>
<li><p>Mentoring / journeying / doing life together is where life is most meaningful (for an introvert, this can be interesting...)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>History:</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, I've written software for companies/organizations to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>manage retail sales, keeping track of daily sales by department for reporting purposes,</p></li>
<li><p>manage gasbar sales, keeping track of customers with accounts and providing statements as necessary,</p></li>
<li><p>keep track of sales opportunities in a "funnel", and track the opportunities from initial contact to implementation,</p></li>
<li><p>allow employees to submit timecards with charges against projects such that they could ratify in real time that the hours they were charging were actually still available in the project.</p></li>
<li><p>provide document management and appropriate team access to documents</p></li>
<li><p>manage client access at a food bank</p></li>
<li><p>automate client's shipping process taking requests from clients and turning them into shipping requests for fulfillment,</p></li>
<li><p>automate helpdesk tasks freeing up technicians to perform more meaningful client support related tasks,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before late 1999, I worked in the Ottawa region in various jobs mostly technical.
In the fall of 1999, I joined International Teams Canada in Elmira, ON and worked with them in various capacities until the end of 2015.</p>
<p>For 10+ years I was on the leadership team for the International Conference on Computing and Mission (ICCM) in the US.  I lead or co-lead the conference for 7 of those years.
I also co-founded the ICCM-Africa conference and co-lead it for its first three years.
In 2013, I was the keynote speaker at ICCM-Australia talking about the intersection of Faith and Technology and how they work together, outlining the use of technology in Scripture.</p>
<p>From 2016 to 2020 I worked at Learning for Humanity (Incorporated and Alliance) which I co-founded.  There I was responsible for all things technical from Hardware to Software to data storage to school and classroom infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Currently</strong></p>
<p>I'm writing software to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>track electrical costs and outputs from providers for being better able to consult with clients about their energy needs.</p></li>
<li><p>track cannabis usage and measure life happiness (less is more)</p></li>
<li><p>other useful software as contracted or as I deem necessary</p></li>
</ul>
