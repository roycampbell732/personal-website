I am a Husband, Father, Grandfather who has an incredibly rich life with his family.

I am also:

* a follower of Jesus Christ
* a hockey fan (my favourite teams are the Ottawa Senators and Edmonton Oilers) and beer league player
* a competitive crokinole player - I use Tracey Boards (https://traceyboards.com), the official boards of the World Crokinole Championships.  The WCC is held the first Saturday of June, each year, in Tavistock, ON Canada
* a Coffee enjoyer - I prefer a good medium-dark roast.  I use both the Aero-Press Coffee press as well as a Breville espresso machine
* a supporter of local micro breweries - Rural Roots in Elmira
* a gamer (both board games - mostly euro style - and computer games - sports preferred)
* a traveller, favourite destination so far, Kenya
* a computer consultant / programmer - I mostly use Python to solve automation and data science problems with occasional web development thrown in
* and occasionally a speaker

Philosophy of life:

* do no harm (easier said than done)
* when designing a solution, ask questions like who's benefitting and who's being hurt (even inadvertently)
* help the widow, orphan, refugee, and otherwise marginalized ahead of the wealthy (the wealthy can usually help themselves)
* I've been told I have a "can do" attitude: "Can it be done" is usually the wrong question - the right question is a combination of "how can it be done?", "should we do it?" and "is it feasible?"
* what's the best practice and does it dictate a commercial solution or will open-source do as good or better job?
