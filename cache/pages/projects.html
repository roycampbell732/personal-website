<p>Currently I have 2 projects on the go.  I will eventually have them linked here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Canbu - tracking a user's canabis habits - this one will become an android app.</p></li>
<li><p>Energy - tracking energy costs per megawatt as published by Ontario Hydro One.  This will be a stripped down version of one I wrote for a client.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm also looking for good datasets to do analysis / data science on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I've recently come across a list of sites with downloadable books and I'm looking at making a more user friendly database from the dataset.</p>
<p>Areas I'm most interested in exploring are larger datasets dealing with real world ideas.  Especially areas that would alleviate poverty.</p>
