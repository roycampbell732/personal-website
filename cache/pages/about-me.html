<p>I am a Husband, Father, Grandfather who has an incredibly rich life with his family.</p>
<p>I am also, a follower of Jesus Christ, a hockey fan (my favourite teams are the Ottawa Senators and Edmonton Oilers) and beer league player, a crokinole player, a computer consultant / developer and occasional speaker.</p>
<p>As a crokinole player, I use Tracey Boards (<a class="reference external" href="https://traceyboards.com">https://traceyboards.com</a>), the official boards of the World Crokinole Championships.  The WCC is held the first Saturday of June, each year, in Tavistock, ON Canada.</p>
<p>Coffee is another hobby horse of mine and I prefer a good medium-dark roast.  I use both the Aero-Press Coffee press as well as a Breville espresso machine.</p>
<p>When it comes to alcohol, I like dark ales, stouts and porters as well as scotch whisky.  I realize I don't need to spell out whisky when mentioning scotch except that I also like some Irish whiskey.  In the right setting, a good dry red wine can also be appreciated.</p>
<p>I grew up in a fairly strict family with traditional evangelical values.  Not long after I moved away from home, I realized that my upbringing had been quite legalistic (incorporating rules and values that claimed to be biblical but which were really cultural).  As a result, I made a personal commitment to only ever be legalistic about not being legalistic.</p>
<p>I also really enjoy travelling.  Favourite destination so far, Kenya.</p>
