I am a Husband, Father, Grandfather who has an incredibly rich life with his family.

I am also, a follower of Jesus Christ, a hockey fan (my favourite teams are the Ottawa Senators and Edmonton Oilers) and beer league player, a crokinole player, a computer consultant / developer and occasional speaker.

As a crokinole player, I use Tracey Boards (https://traceyboards.com), the official boards of the World Crokinole Championships.  The WCC is held the first Saturday of June, each year, in Tavistock, ON Canada.

Coffee is another hobby horse of mine and I prefer a good medium-dark roast.  I use both the Aero-Press Coffee press as well as a Breville espresso machine.

When it comes to alcohol, I like dark ales, stouts and porters as well as scotch whisky.  I realize I don't need to spell out whisky when mentioning scotch except that I also like some Irish whiskey.  In the right setting, a good dry red wine can also be appreciated.

I grew up in a fairly strict family with traditional evangelical values.  Not long after I moved away from home, I realized that my upbringing had been quite legalistic (incorporating rules and values that claimed to be biblical but which were really cultural).  As a result, I made a personal commitment to only ever be legalistic about not being legalistic.

I also really enjoy travelling.  Favourite destination so far, Kenya.
