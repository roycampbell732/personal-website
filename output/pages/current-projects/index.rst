Currently I have 2 projects on the go.
I will eventually have them linked here:
* Canbu - tracking a user's canabis habits - this one will become an android app.
* Energy - tracking energy costs per megawatt as published by Ontario Hydro One.  This will be a stripped down version of one I wrote for a client.

* I'm also looking for good datasets to do analysis / data science on.

I've recently come across a list of sites with downloadable books and I'm looking at making a more user friendly database from the dataset.

Areas I'm most interested in exploring are larger datasets dealing with real world ideas.  Especially areas that would alleviate poverty.
